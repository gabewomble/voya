# Voya

This repo contains the code for the Voya application. The `app` directory contains the source code for the web application, while the `server` directory contains the source code for the backend application.

To learn more about each application, visit the README files in their respective directories:

- [app README](./app/README.md)
- [server README](./server/README.md)

## Update

This repo hosts the source code for the Voya application, which was a group trip planning application I was building with Go and Qwikjs. I got bored of the project, so I'm leaving it as is.
